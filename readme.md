 # Potluck
 
 Make a "toy" Sinatra app in a brand new project folder. Start building your own application, using similar techniques that your group project is using (e.g. testing, service classes, etc).

 Here's an idea for your toy project: Make a potluck manager, where a host can define a new event and have their guests indicate what they'll be bringing to that event. (This way, not everyone shows up with cookies.)
